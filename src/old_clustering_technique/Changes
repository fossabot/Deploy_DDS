In old clustering region were identified based on clusters but it identification of data points from cluster is bad as idea.
point-A from cluster-A might have less distance from centroid of cluster-B.

So to resolve this problem,
1. Rather then one point(centriod) for identification of region , more points are required. 
2. Now optimal points will be,
  I.    centriod
  II.   maximum distace from centroid
  III.  minimum distance from centroid
  IV.   maximum distance from origin 
  V.    minimum distance from origin
all the above points will be from same ccluster and indicates same cluster.
3. for new point, measure distance from all the above points and do it for all the cluster points.
4. The point with least distance and associated cluster will denotes the cluster associated with new point.
