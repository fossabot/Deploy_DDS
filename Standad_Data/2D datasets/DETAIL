To validation and visulize the behaviour of clustering algorithm 
code is developed. It is directly part of main code.
with changes in select_feature.py file. 

to validate the clustering algorith,
1. Run the python generate_dataset.py to generate the dataset 

2. After obtaining dataset 
run:
python main.py
obtain result 

3.compare training set result with actaul dataset by
python verify_result.py
