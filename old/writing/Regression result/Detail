Chnage the file directory and pressure tag as per requirement 
and then run the code by
python final_plotting.py

Input:

file_tag:
define pressure at which all files are generated

dir_name:
define directory that contains .csv file of all fuels

analysis_type:
in chnage the analysis_type by  'Full' or 'Half'.
where 
'Full' - analyze all the data 
'Half' - analyze only data of higher temprature
 

output:
It will give plot inside ./plots 
and in current directory it will genetae Ea_by_R_'tag passed'.csv file

This file will be useful to show relationship between Ea_by_R vs no_of_SH_carbon

############################################################


After obtaining all the result,
-> Now copy all the Ea_by_R values from all the Ea_by_R_'tag passed'.csv files to coeff.csv file my matching bond length to CXX values.

It will process all the columns from 2 to end and do regression over it.

-> edit input in comparision_plot.py and run
python comparision_plot.py

output:
plot of regression in ./plots directory
