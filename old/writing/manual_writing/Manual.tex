\section{Introduction:}


\subsection{Ignition delay brief intro:}


 Chemical reaction and transport process are main components of the combustion process. In combustion, chemical reaction have different time scales which is called as a ignition delay. It is also major combustion property. Ignition delay can be divided into two parts: 
 \begin{enumerate}
 	\item Physical Ignition Delay 
 	\subitem Physical ignition delay depends on different physical phenomenon of combustion process such as, atomization of fuel, heating, evaporation rate of fuel, etc.
 	\item Chemical Ignition Delay
 	\subitem Chemical ignition delay depends on type of fuel, molecular structure of fuel, equivalence ratio etc. 
 \end{enumerate} 
 
 \subsection{Why ignition delay?} 
 Ignition delay is crucial parameter for combustor and IC engines. Right amount of ignition delay is essential for efficient working of such devices. Calculation of ignition delay is computationally intensive as it requires time consuming simulations which includes detailed complex chemistry as well. To resolve such issue; accurate, simplified, and efficient framework has been designed to predict the ignition delay. To predict ignition delay, shock tube data of n-alkanes is utilized. 

\subsection{Key-idea behind framework:} \label{sec:key_idea}
The goal of a framework is to predict ignition delay. For that, machine learning concepts, multiple linear regression is used along with concept of the recursive tree. To divide the data based on error, tertiary tree is utilized. The whole process is summarized briefly below:

 \begin{enumerate}
	\item Fit regression plane on all the fuel data using multiple regression.
	\item Calculate relative error of the actual and predicted value for all data.
	\item Data points which has relative error less than specified criteria will be combined in one bin called \textbf{center cluster}
	
	\item Other data, which has relative error more than  specified criteria will be further bifurcated based on absolute error of actual and predicted value.
	
	\item Data points which has positive absolute error has lies on one side of the fitted plane and other data points which has negative sign lies on other side of the fitted plane.
	
	\item Thus, three clusters will be obtained in which,
	\subitem \textbf{Left cluster} : Data points which has relative error more than specified error and actual error has positive sign.
	
	\subitem \textbf{Center Cluster} : Data points which has relative error less than specified criteria.
	
	\subitem \textbf{Right Cluster} : Data points which has relative error more than specified error and actual error has negative sign. 
 \end{enumerate} 
 	Center cluster will give a correlation for the data and will not be divided further. Whereas, Left and Right cluster may also give correlation if they satisfies the specified relative error criteria, otherwise it will be divided recursively by following step:1-6 until specified relative error criteria is not fulfilled.

     \caption{Division of cluster based on Relative Error}
     \label{fig:cluster0}
 \end{figure}

%\clearpage
For example, after fitting the first regression plane, result of the actual and predicted value is shown in fig~\ref{fig:cluster0}. Blue colour shows, the data points which has relative error less than 5\%. Green and orange colored data points have relative error more than 5\%. Apart from relative error, absolute error also plays essential role in clustering. Orange data point have positive absolute error and green data points have negative absolute error. By this way, three clusters is  obtained. Further, orange and green data points will be divided into three clusters individually following the same procedure explained above. Obtained result is shown in fig~\ref{fig:cluster1} and \ref{fig:cluster2}.

 	\caption{Conceptual tree diagram of procedure}
 	\label{fig:tree}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Each center clusters gives one correlation  for prediction of ignition delay.} \textbf{Left and right clusters can also give correlation or can generate cluster if it satisfies the specified relative error criteria} \textbf{else, it will further divide into more parts/clusters till relative error criteria is not satisfied for data-points which is given in fig-\ref{fig:tree}.} For example distribution of data points in different cluster is shown in fig~\ref{fig:datapoints_tree}.

	\caption{Division of data points in different clusters}
	\label{fig:datapoints_tree}
\end{figure}

Along with that, the regression coefficient obtained  after following the whole procedure is given in fig~.\ref{fig:coef_tree}. From figure~\ref{fig:coef_tree}, it is clear that the nodes highlighted with red borders shows final clusters. The correlation obtained by highlighted clusters as in fig-\ref{fig:coef_tree} are useful for prediction of ignition delay value. Calculation of centroid and distance of data points from those centroid plays major role in prediction. 

The formulation of multiple linear regression used to find out the correlation is given as,
\begin{align}
	\tau &= \beta_0 \frac{P}{P_0}^{\beta_1} X_{fuel}^{\beta_2} X_{oxi}^{\beta_3} exp \bigg({\beta_4 \frac{T_0}{T} + \beta_5 \frac{T_0}{T \times C_{SH}}}\bigg) \\
	 &= \beta_0 \frac{P}{P_0}^{\beta_1} X_{fuel}^{\beta_2} X_{oxi}^{\beta_3} exp \bigg(\frac{1}{T}\bigg\{\underbrace{\beta_4 {T_0} + \beta_5 \frac{T_0}{C_{SH}}}_\text{similar to $\frac{E_a}{R}$}\bigg\}\bigg)
\end{align}		 

Here, all the $\beta_i$ values indicates the regression coefficients. {P-pressure, $X_{fuel}$-fuel mole fraction,$ X_{oxi}$-oxidizer mole fraction, T-temperature, $C_{SH}$-number of secondary carbon and hydrogen bonds} are the features of the equation. $P_0$ and $T_0$ are reference pressure and temperature.
