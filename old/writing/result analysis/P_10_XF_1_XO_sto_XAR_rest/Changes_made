chemkin_all : folder contains all the data 
chemkin : data with 0 ignition delay is removed for bettter plotting 
10_BAR_result folder contains all the result 

changes::::
some result files are deleted as they old mechanism are used and they give bad results
list of such file and name changed:
'Useful to find actual mechanism'
detailed_heptane_10_export.csv  - deleted
Updated_Heptane_10_export.csv - C7_10_export.csv
updatd_hexane_10_export.csv - C6_10_export.csv

Major chnage:
It was founnd that update_hexane was wrongly simulated with heptae mechanism so, update_hexane folder name is replaced with updated_heptane_NOT_hexane.

and updated_hexane mechanism is correctly simulated
